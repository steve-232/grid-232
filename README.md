# grid-232
I use this CSS grid in mine own projects. There is no default styles (buttons, inputs...), so you have full freedom. <br />
Grid has base width of 1280px and 12 columns. Width of columns is presented in percents (%) and beacuse of that it is very ease to manipulate with the base grid width.

There is also a [list](https://github.com/steve-232/grid-232/blob/master/helper-classes.css) of helper css classes, which can be very useful in everyday developing.

## Installation
Download and include `grid-232.css` in your project. <br />
Also if you want to use `helper classes` download and include `helper-classes.css` at the end of your main css file.
